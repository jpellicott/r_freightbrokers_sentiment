I have a strong book of business that I’ve stayed in contact with while I’ve been away, my absolute best carriers and people I’ve actually been good friends with.\\n\\nI know this market favors the carrier but I have reliable trucks that take good rates. I’ve never worked at an up and coming brokerage so I’d like some advice on what I should expect if I take this job. I’m only used to the big 3PL with 10,000+ loads per day to work with, this company is in the hundreds per day.\\n\\nI want to make good money and I’m prepared to make less for a while, but I really don’t have any experience with smaller ...</td>\n",
